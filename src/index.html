    Welcome to LWC (Open Source!)
    In order to start with this, we simply run in the command line: npx create-lwc-app appName
    If this is your first time running this command, it will install create-lwc-app so in the future, you can just make the app
    This will add a folder in your current directory with the name that you give it in the command as well as everything else
    you'll want for developing. You'll typically want to use the Simple Setup and create the Standard Web App as options.

    The command will also give us a boilerplate index.html. Our components are by default in the my namespace, but we can rename this.
    The standard web app also comes with 2 prebuilt components: app, and greeting.

    We can find documentation on OS LWC here: lwc.dev
    OS LWC is more updated than the Platform LWC, as it updates roughly every week as opposed to 3x a year for the platform. Additionally,
    OS LWC has some features that Platform LWC will never have. The downside is that we cannot work directly with data like we can
    for Platform LWC, and we also do not have access to any prebuilt components (like lightning-button).

    Now for installing and previewing our changes:
    - We need to install Node.js first
    - Once that is done, we must update npm: npm install -g npm@latest
    - Create the project with: npx create-lwc-app appName
    - This will also install create-lwc-app
    - In order to preview our build, we need yarn: npm install --global yarn
    - After, we need nodemon and lwc-services, so run these 2 commands:
        - yarn global add nodemon
        - yarn global add lwc-services
    NOTE: You may need to configure yourself to run scripts: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    - Finally, we can run our localhost by using: yarn watch
    - To kill the command, press Ctrl + C
