    Description: Basics of using Platform LWC
-->

<!--
    Lightning Web Components
    - Use the modern web standard
    - Frameworks like React, Angular, and Aura are really nice, but can be quite different and abstracts the process
      - Now, native JS has caught up with these framework features and they aren't necessary
    - Enter: Web Components
    - Runs natively in the browser
      - Lightweight and even better performance
    - There are some features that Aura has that Web does not. Otherwise, use LWC
      - A list can be found here: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.get_started_supported_experiences

    - If you built an application hosted outside of Experience Sites, imagine the frameworks you'd have to know:
      - Aura for the SF side
      - React, Angular or Vue for the site
    - LWC are open source and also can be used without SF at all

    - In order to begin developing these, we can use VS Code with a bit of setup or we can use: webcomponents.dev/create/lwc
    - If you want to use VS Code:
      - Install Node.js
      - Run: npm install -g node-gyp
      - Run: sfdx plugins:install @salesforce/lwc-dev-server
        - Optionally for mobile, also run: sfdx plugins:install @salesforce/lwc-dev-mobile
      - Use the command palette to start and stop the local server

<!--
    Each component lives inside its own folder. This folder will define the names of the files required in it. These folders
    also have some requirements to the name:
    - Must begin with a lowercase letter
    - Must contain only alphanumeric or underscore characters (no special characters like %, $, ;, \, etc)
    - Must be unique in the namespace
    - Can't include whitespace
    - Can't end in an underscore
    - Can't contain 2 consectutive underscores
    - Can't contain a hyphen

    HTML standards require custom elements to contain a hyphen. After all, that's what these components are: custom elements.
    Our components will always meet this standard because the format for a component is: 
      namespace-component-name
    What's that? Our component names cannot contain hyphens you say? Yes, if we use camelCase notation, when we reference the component
    name it will convert it to kebab-case such as above. Best practice? Only use alphanumeric characters and camelCase your names.

<!--
    On to the files themselves
    HTML - A normal HTML file, just put in a template tag to take advantage of components
    JS - A bit different now, contains a class for our component
    Meta - The metadata file for our component. We'll unfortunately need to manipulate this for certain features
    Optional: CSS - Style declarations for our component
-->
<template>
  <!-- SHADOW BOUNDARY HERE -->

  <div class="container">
    <!-- The template tag can be imagined as the bounds of the virtual DOM of the component -->
    <h1 class="slds-text-heading_large">Basics of Lightning Web Components</h1>

    <!-- Directives are special HTML attributes we can use for some basic but very useful functionality -->

    <!-- if:true|false allows conditional rendering for a truthy or falsey value -->
    <template if:true={detailsActive}>
      <p>We can use Directives to conditionally render!</p>
    </template>

    <!-- THIS IS NOT EXPRESSION SYNTAX! These are called Identifiers, and reference properties and methods -->
    <lightning-button label={btnLabel} onclick={handleClick}></lightning-button>

    <p>We can also used Directives to iterate over a list</p>

    <div class="iteration-holder">
      <ul>
        <!-- for:each will loop over a collection, and for:item gives a variable for the item. for:index will set your index value -->
        <template for:each={myGuitarists} for:item="guitarist">

          <!-- Each item must have a key using the key directive. It must be a string/number, and must be unique -->
          <li class="info-holder" key={guitarist.name}>
            <div class="info">{guitarist.name}</div>
            <div class="info"><img src={guitarist.image} /></div>
          </li>
        </template>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <p>Using the iterator directive, we can do special functionality on the first and last elements!</p>
        <!-- The iterator directive works like for:each, but can perform special actions on the first and last value -->
        <template iterator:myiterator={myGuitarists}>
          <li key={myiterator.value.name}>

            <!-- Combining the if:true|false directive with the first and last -->
            <hr if:true={myiterator.first} />
            {myiterator.value.name}
            <hr if:true={myiterator.last} />
          </li>
        </template>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

</template>
<!-- Lets take a moment to speak about the Shadow DOM -->
<!--
     The Shadow DOM is a modern design standard that will provide encapsulation for your component. Each component has its own 
     Shadow DOM, the structure of which is called the shadow tree. The Shadow DOM begins and ends with the shadow boundary.
     
     So what happens at the shadow boundary? A few things:
     - CSS styles stop cascading
     - Events bubbling up and crossing the boundary will change property values to match the listening scope
       - This is called event retargeting. The value of Event.target normally holds the element that was the target of the
         event. For example, if you were to click on a <p> tag, the target would be that <p> tag. If this was not changed,
         it would bypass the encapsulation of the Shadow DOM. So instead, this property is changed once the event bubbles
         past the shadow boundary. So instead, the event is retargeted to the first element outside of the shadow boundary
     - Elements passed via a Slot bypasses the shadow boundary
     - Elements in the shadow tree cannot be queried for. A component can query for elements in its shadow tree using
       the this.template.querySelector() method.
